# The Changing Role Of Consultants In An Agile Workforce

## Why Agile forces us to provide more value to clients than in traditional Waterfall projects.

With the adoption of Agile practices in enterprise, consultants must be increasingly
involved with their clients' business needs.

It’s becoming rarer for a consultant to be given a completed specifications
document and expected to "check in" at a later time to deliver a finished product.
Instead, units of work are becoming smaller and subject to changes of direction.

To effectively contribute to a software project that isn't completely defined at
the point of commencement, consultants must be aware of how their positions
and responsibilities have changed.

## You'll Need An Increased Understanding Of Product

In the traditional outsourcing model, a client would treat consultancy workers as
‘black-boxes’ of productivity — requirements go in, completed work comes out.

Consultants would have some understanding of the intention behind the product’s
commissioning, but could ultimately get by without asking deeper questions.

Now as Agile calls for more tightly-scoped requirements, consultants are given
a much smaller picture of the entire product at each stage of development. The
true scope of the work is not known until the completion of the project because
— by design — it’s being defined on-the-fly.

As a result, consultants cannot rely on their clients having all the answers all
the time, and need to increase their understanding of the product as a whole.
Instead of being instructed what to make and when, consultants must develop
their own intuitive understanding of the project’s direction, size and priorities.

## Increased Your Alignment with Client Productivity Structure

The hallmark of offshore-contractor horror stories is the disappointing discovery
after a product is seemingly delivered on time, and to budget. Upon closer
inspection, the delivered product is so poorly constructed, that the subsequent
cost to maintain or extend it, far exceeds the initial savings from outsourcing
in the first place.

This is a symptom of vendors who are happy to be instructed on what needs to be
built, but are left alone to develop the associated execution strategy and
implementation plan. This can lead to a situation where, not only is the
initial product build outsourced, but decisions about the cost of support,
maintenance and future development, have also ceded to the vendor.

Businesses have endured the risk associated with outsourced workers traditionally
having autonomy around the implementation strategy for a product. As a result,
many enterprises are moving to Agile, to reclaim their authority of ‘the how’ as
well as ‘the what’.
