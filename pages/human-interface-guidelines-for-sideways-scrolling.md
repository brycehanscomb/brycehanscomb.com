# Human Interface Guidelines For Sideways Scrolling

## Things to consider when building web UIs that go horizontal.

* Keyboard shortcuts
    - left and right arrows
    - up and down arrows remap to left and right?
    - space / shift+space
    - page up/page down
    - tab
    - home / end
    - fn+arrow keys
* URL hash skip
* Smooth scrolling
* Mouse wheel
* Zoomin / zoomout
* css position sticky implications
* long paragraphs still overflow vertically (watch your screen height)
* careful of chrome's back-and-forward navigation gestures
* persist scroll position when returning via back-button
* maintain scroll position on window resize
* information hierarchy (H1's at the top...or the left?)
* what about the footer?
* how does the content re-flow when AdBlockers remove content?
* Printing
* selecting text in a multi-column layout
* Firefox Caret Browsing
* non left-to-right text layouts
